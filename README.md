Freecodecamp web-design projects

## Tribute Page

In this challenge we should build a tribute page using mainly HTML and plain CSS. Additional technologies (for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) were not recommended for this project. The page should look similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.
For this project I created a tribute page for Agatha Christie using HTML5 and plain CSS3.
