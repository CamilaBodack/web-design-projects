# Responsive Web Design Projects

Freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Projects

In all challenges we should build responsive web pages using mostly HTML,  plain CSS and Javascript. Additional technologies (for example jQuery, React, Angular or Vue) were not recommended for these projects.

## Tribute Page

 1. **First challenge: Tribute Page**

 In this project, we should build a tribute page that should look like this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx
 For this project I created a tribute page for Agatha Christie using HTML5, plain CSS3 and an express server.

## Survey form

2. **Second Challenge: Survey Form**

In this project, we should build a survey form similar to this one: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP.
I created a survey form using HTML5, CSS3, and express, focused on RPG players who are looking for live actions, new histories and new places to play.
